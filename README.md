Scripts to download, install, and upgrade Linux third party programs

Certain third party applications are updated at a much higher rate than the
average Linux distribution can provide. The applications covered here are the
upstream versions of Firefox, Palemoon, Thunderbird, and Telegram Desktop.
The included scripts manage installation and upgrade of these programs in the
system's private /opt directory.

This was created in context of and for the Debian based 'Window Maker Live'
project, but the principal fetch scripts should work just fine on any kind of
Linux system.
