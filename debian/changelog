  * usr/sbin/fsmlfetch: Added procedure to first determine protected download
    URL and use this one for the actual download. This way we can get rid of
    midori and use wget for retrieval.

  * usr/sbin/pmoonfetch: Enhance langpack download routine.

  * usr/sbin/[ffox|tbrd]fetch: Enhance langpack download routine.

  * usr/sbin/tlgrmfetch: Modified version check routine and adapted it for
    wget instead of links. This finally removes the dependency on links.

  * Correct erroneous grep command at the end of each fetch script which
    prevented tehm from a timely exit.

  * debian/control: Removed obsolete dependency on links package.
